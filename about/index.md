##### Open Source

FirmAI is an open source data analytics and business automation company. It is our mission to open up access to the business tools necessary for state of the art automation. FirmAI's goal is to democratise firm automation by 2030. FirmAI provides free consulting services to charities on a case to case basis. FirmAI currently operates in the hospitality and senior age care & retirement sector.

##### Data

At FirmAI we are well aware that data availability is the most pressing source-concern for small to medium businesses. The technology stack underlying the future of firm automation is set to become a lot more accessible and widely distributed, while the accessibility to data is uncertain. This significantly enhances the probability of monopoly powers engaging in rent seeking activities. FirmAI catalogues publicly available data from web-scraping and other activities.

##### Technology

We pride ourselves in using a wide range of technologies to solve and automate the most complex and pressing business problems. In prediction tasks we use the best libraries of the day to facilitate accurate predictions. This includes libraries such as Google's Tensorflow and PyTorch for deeplearning. For ensemble models we consult Microsofts' LightGBM and other open source tools. This is combined with research level analysis of features in datasets, which provide companies with decision making clarity. Our technology stack is very modern and ever-evolving. For decision making we make use of an adapted version of IBM and Googles' decision optimisation algorithms and various other strategic programs such as those developed by the RAND Corporation.
