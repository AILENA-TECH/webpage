[Charles Hoffman](CharlesHoffmanCPA) is working on "creating a tool that accountants creating XBRL-based financial reports, internal auditors reviewing those reports, and/or external auditors attesting to those reports can use to verify that the report is created correctly.  I am doing a lot of “deductive” reasoning to explicitly verify that the report is created correctly mechanically, structurally, mathematically, logically.  What would be a really good addition to that functionality is an “inductive” reasoning system that also helped in the process of verifying the report.  Once that tool exists, people can begin to truly understand the power of AI."
